docker build -t ai-deep-research-mcp .
docker run -p 8000:8000 ai-deep-research-mcp
```

### VS Code MCP Integration
1. Add to Claude Desktop config:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ai-deep-research": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "src"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/ai-deep-research-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

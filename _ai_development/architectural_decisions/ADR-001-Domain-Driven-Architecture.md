# ADR-001: Domain-Driven Architecture for AI Deep Research MCP

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-07-31  
**Deciders**: Command Architect, Recursive Analyst  
**Technical Story**: Establish architectural foundation for AI research system

## Context

The AI Deep Research MCP system requires a robust, maintainable architecture that can:
1. Support complex research workflows across multiple data sources
2. Maintain clear separation of concerns for educational clarity
3. Enable autonomous agent collaboration and development
4. Scale from educational examples to production deployment
5. Integrate multiple external services (search engines, AI models, databases)

The system serves dual purposes:
- **Educational**: Middle school through professor-level learning resource
- **Production**: Autonomous AI research platform with MCP integration

## Decision

We will adopt **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** architecture with the following structure:

```
src/
├── domain/          # Core business logic and entities
├── application/     # Use cases and application services  
├── infrastructure/  # External system integrations
├── presentation/    # User interfaces and APIs
└── core/           # Shared base classes and patterns
```

### Key Architectural Principles:

1. **Domain Purity**: Domain layer contains only business logic, no external dependencies
2. **Dependency Inversion**: Higher layers depend on lower layer abstractions
3. **Single Responsibility**: Each layer has one clear purpose
4. **Educational Alignment**: Architecture supports learning progression
5. **Agent Coordination**: Structure enables autonomous development

### Layer Responsibilities:

- **Domain**: Research entities, business rules, domain services
- **Application**: Use cases, orchestration, DTOs
- **Infrastructure**: External APIs, databases, file systems, MCP connections
- **Presentation**: Web interfaces, CLI, MCP server endpoints
- **Core**: Shared abstractions, base classes, common utilities

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Clear separation enables educational progression (students learn layer by layer)
- Multiple agents can work on different layers without conflicts
- Testing isolation (unit tests in domain, integration tests in infrastructure)
- Flexible external service integration
- Supports both educational and production requirements

### Negative:
- More complex than simple script-based approach
- Requires understanding of DDD principles
- Initial setup overhead for new features

### Neutral:
- Requires consistent application of patterns across all agents

## Implementation Notes

### For Educational Integration:
- Each layer maps to learning pathway modules
- Examples progress from simple (domain) to complex (full stack)
- Analogies align with architectural boundaries

### For Agent Coordination:
- Domain changes require Command Architect approval
- Application layer managed by Recursive Analyst
- Infrastructure coordinated with Infra Watchdog
- Testing patterns established by Test Guardian

# ADR-003: Multi-Agent Coordination Protocol

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-07-31  
**Deciders**: Command Architect, Recursive Analyst  
**Technical Story**: Establish coordination framework for autonomous agent collaboration

## Context

The AI Deep Research MCP system requires coordination between multiple autonomous agents:
- **Command Architect**: Strategic oversight and decision approval
- **Recursive Analyst**: Architecture analysis and improvement proposals
- **Test Guardian**: Comprehensive testing framework development
- **Infra Watchdog**: Infrastructure deployment and monitoring
- **Knowledge Librarian**: Documentation and knowledge management
- **UI Curator**: User interface and experience design

**Coordination Challenges Identified**:
1. **Task Dependencies**: Infrastructure → Application → Testing → Deployment
2. **Resource Conflicts**: Multiple agents modifying shared components
3. **Knowledge Sharing**: Ensuring insights flow between agents
4. **Educational Alignment**: Maintaining consistency with learning pathways
5. **Quality Consistency**: Uniform standards across agent outputs

## Decision

We will implement a **Structured Multi-Agent Coordination Protocol** with the following components:

### 1. **Command Hub Communication**

**Central Coordination Location**: `_ai_development/development_logs/`

**Communication Structure**:
```
_ai_development/development_logs/
├── COMMAND_CENTER_LOG.md          # Central coordination hub
├── {AGENT}_DAILY_REPORTS.md       # Individual agent status updates
├── CROSS_AGENT_DECISIONS.md       # Multi-agent decision tracking
└── COORDINATION_ISSUES.md         # Blockers and dependencies
```

**Communication Protocol**:
- **Daily Status Updates**: Each agent posts progress, blockers, and next steps
- **Decision Requests**: Major changes require Command Architect approval via formal request
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Significant insights shared immediately in command center
- **Handoff Protocol**: Clear documentation when one agent passes work to another

### 2. **Task Dependency Management**

**Dependency Declaration**:
```markdown
## Agent Task Template
**Agent**: [Agent Name]
**Task**: [Description]
**Dependencies**: [Required completions from other agents]
**Outputs**: [What this produces for other agents]
**Coordination Needed**: [Which agents need to be involved]
**Educational Alignment**: [How this maintains educational promises]
```

**Coordination Workflows**:
- **Infrastructure Changes**: Recursive Analyst → Command Architect → Infra Watchdog → Test Guardian
- **Feature Development**: Educational Requirement → Design → Implementation → Testing → Documentation
- **Quality Issues**: Discovery Agent → Test Guardian → Responsible Agent → Verification

### 3. **Knowledge Sharing Framework**

**Shared Knowledge Artifacts**:
- **ADRs**: All architectural decisions documented and accessible
- **Design Patterns**: Reusable solutions cataloged by Knowledge Librarian
- **Testing Patterns**: Test Guardian establishes patterns for other agents
- **Implementation Templates**: Recursive Analyst provides reusable structures

**Knowledge Flow Protocol**:
1. **Discovery**: Agent identifies insight or pattern
2. **Documentation**: Create formal document or update existing
3. **Notification**: Alert relevant agents via command hub
4. **Integration**: Other agents incorporate knowledge into their work
5. **Feedback Loop**: Results feed back to improve shared knowledge

### 4. **Educational Alignment Enforcement**

**Educational Consistency Checks**:
- All agents must verify their outputs align with learning pathway promises
- New implementations must include educational examples or documentation
- Changes to educational content require multi-agent review
- Quality bar: "Can a middle school student follow this?"

**Alignment Validation Process**:
1. **Pre-Implementation**: Check educational requirements
2. **During Development**: Maintain educational examples
3. **Post-Completion**: Verify educational promises fulfilled
4. **Documentation Update**: Update learning pathways if needed

### 5. **Conflict Resolution Framework**

**Escalation Path**:
1. **Direct Resolution**: Agents attempt direct coordination
2. **Command Hub Discussion**: Open issue in central log
3. **Command Architect Decision**: Final arbiter for conflicts
4. **ADR Documentation**: Decision becomes architectural precedent

**Common Conflict Types**:
- **Resource Contention**: Multiple agents wanting to modify same component
- **Approach Disagreement**: Different technical approaches to same problem
- **Priority Conflicts**: Competing urgent tasks from different agents
- **Educational Alignment**: Balancing educational vs. technical requirements

## Implementation Guidelines

### **For Command Architect**:
- Review all ADRs and major decisions
- Maintain strategic alignment across agents
- Resolve conflicts when direct coordination fails
- Approve resource-intensive or architectural changes

### **For Recursive Analyst**:
- Initiate cross-agent coordination for architectural changes
- Provide technical analysis to support multi-agent decisions
- Monitor for coordination breakdowns and process improvements
- Maintain ADR documentation and decision tracking

### **For All Agents**:
- Post daily status updates in command hub
- Declare dependencies and coordination needs upfront
- Seek approval for changes affecting other agents
- Maintain educational alignment in all outputs
- Document handoffs and knowledge transfers

### **Communication Standards**:
- **Status Updates**: Daily, structured format
- **Decision Requests**: Formal format with context, options, and recommendation
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Immediate notification with structured documentation
- **Conflict Escalation**: Clear problem statement with attempted resolutions

## Consequences

### Positive:
- **Reduced Conflicts**: Clear protocols prevent agent collision
- **Knowledge Multiplication**: Insights shared across all agents
- **Quality Consistency**: Uniform standards and review processes
- **Educational Integrity**: Systematic alignment with learning objectives
- **Scalable Coordination**: Framework supports adding new agents

### Negative:
- **Communication Overhead**: More documentation and coordination required
- **Decision Latency**: Some decisions may take longer due to approval processes
- **Process Complexity**: Agents must learn and follow coordination protocols

### Neutral:
- **Cultural Change**: Shift from independent to coordinated autonomous work
- **Documentation Volume**: Increased documentation requirements

## Success Metrics

### **Coordination Effectiveness**:
- **Conflict Rate**: <5% of agent interactions result in conflicts
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Insights propagate to other agents within 24 hours
- **Decision Speed**: Routine decisions < 4 hours, complex decisions < 24 hours
- **Educational Alignment**: 100% of agent outputs maintain educational promises

### **Process Health**:
- **Communication Completeness**: All agents post regular status updates
- **Dependency Management**: No agent blocked >48 hours on dependencies
- **Quality Consistency**: Uniform standards across all agent outputs

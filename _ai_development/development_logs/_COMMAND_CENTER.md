## Educational Quality Standards

### Code Commentary Requirements
- Every class and function must have educational docstrings
- Complex algorithms must include step-by-step explanations
- Design decisions must be documented and justified
- Examples must be practical and engaging for middle school students

### Progressive Complexity Structure
- **Level 1**: Basic concepts and simple examples
- **Level 2**: Individual component functionality
- **Level 3**: Component interactions and system architecture
- **Level 4**: Advanced features and customization
- **Level 5**: Contributing to the project and extending functionality

### Learning Objective Alignment
Every refactored component must teach:
- Programming fundamentals (variables, functions, classes)
- Object-oriented design principles
- Software engineering best practices
- AI and machine learning concepts
- Professional development workflow

## Communication Protocols

### Daily Status Updates
Each agent should update their homebase README with:
- Tasks completed today
- Current work in progress  
- Blockers or questions for Command Architect
- Estimated completion timeline

### Code Review Process
1. Agent completes educational enhancement
2. Self-review for educational quality and functionality
3. Update tests and documentation
4. Request Command Architect review
5. Address feedback and finalize changes

### Quality Gates
Before any component is considered complete:
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] Educational value significantly enhanced
- [ ] Tests maintain 100% coverage
- [ ] Documentation updated with learning materials
- [ ] Code follows educational commentary standards

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Next 24 Hours)
1. **Establish Agent Homebases**: Create dedicated workspaces for each agent
2. **Begin Core Refactoring**: Start with foundational components
3. **Create Learning Materials**: Develop initial tutorial content
4. **Test Infrastructure**: Ensure refactoring doesn't break existing tests

### Weekly Milestones
- **Week 1**: Foundation and core components refactored
- **Week 2**: Research pipeline components enhanced
- **Week 3**: Interface and API layers improved
- **Week 4**: Comprehensive testing and documentation
- **Week 5**: Educational deployment and validation

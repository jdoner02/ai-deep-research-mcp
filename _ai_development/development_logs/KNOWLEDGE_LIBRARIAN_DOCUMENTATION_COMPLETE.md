## 🚀 Ready for UI Integration

### **For UI Curator** - Next Phase Priorities:

#### 1. **Web Interface Integration** (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Update search forms to include scholarly source options
- Add academic source result formatting and display
- Implement citation formatting for academic papers
- Create scholarly source selection toggles

#### 2. **Academic Result Presentation** (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Special formatting for academic papers (title, authors, citations, venue)
- PDF download links for available papers
- Citation count display and sorting options
- Source attribution (arXiv vs Semantic Scholar vs Google Scholar)

#### 3. **Search Enhancement** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- Academic vs web search mode toggle
- Advanced academic search filters (year range, citation count, venue)
- Result categorization by academic rigor
- Export options for academic citations

### **Technical Integration Points:**
```python
# UI Curator can now use these imports
from src.infrastructure import (
    UnifiedScholarlySearcher,
    ArxivSearcher,
    SemanticScholarSearcher
)

# Example web interface integration
searcher = UnifiedScholarlySearcher()
papers = searcher.search(user_query, max_results=10)

# Papers now include all metadata for rich UI display:
# - title, authors, abstract
# - citation_count, venue, year
# - pdf_url, source_url
# - source_type (for UI differentiation)
```

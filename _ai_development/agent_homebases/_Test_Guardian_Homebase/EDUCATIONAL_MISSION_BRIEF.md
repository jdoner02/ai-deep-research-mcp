### Educational Testing Principles
1. **Tests as Documentation**: Every test explains what the code should do
2. **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, build to professional level
3. **Real-World Examples**: Test actual functionality, not toy problems
4. **Multiple Testing Types**: Unit, integration, end-to-end, performance

## üìö Educational Test Examples

### Level 1: Basic Testing Concepts

#### Example: Your First Test
```python
"""
Educational Example: Writing Your First Test

WHAT IS A TEST?
A test is like a quality check for your code. Imagine you're building
a calculator - you'd want to check that 2 + 2 actually equals 4, right?
That's exactly what a test does!

WHY TEST?
- Catch bugs before users do
- Make sure changes don't break existing features
- Document how your code should behave
- Give you confidence your code works

HOW TO READ THIS TEST:
1. Setup: Prepare what you need
2. Action: Do the thing you want to test
3. Assert: Check that it worked correctly
"""

def test_simple_addition():
    # Setup: Create a simple calculator
    # (In real code, this might be a more complex object)
    def add_numbers(a, b):
        return a + b
    
    # Action: Use the calculator to add two numbers
    result = add_numbers(2, 3)
    
    # Assert: Check that we got the right answer
    assert result == 5, f"Expected 5, but got {result}"
    
    # SUCCESS! This test passes because 2 + 3 really does equal 5
    print("‚úÖ Great! Your calculator works correctly!")
```

#### Example: Testing Error Conditions
```python
"""
Educational Example: Testing What Happens When Things Go Wrong

REAL WORLD INSIGHT:
Professional software needs to handle errors gracefully. 
What happens if someone tries to divide by zero? Or searches 
for something that doesn't exist? Good tests check these scenarios!

DESIGN PATTERN: Exception Testing
This shows how to test that your code properly handles error conditions.
"""

import pytest  # pytest is a popular testing framework

def test_division_by_zero_handled_properly():
    """
    Test that our calculator properly handles division by zero.
    
    In math, dividing by zero is undefined. Our calculator should
    raise a helpful error message instead of crashing mysteriously.
    """
    def safe_divide(a, b):
        if b == 0:
            raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero! That's undefined in mathematics.")
        return a / b
    
    # Test that the function raises the expected error
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Cannot divide by zero"):
        safe_divide(10, 0)
    
    print("‚úÖ Great! Our calculator handles errors properly!")
```

### Level 2: Testing Patterns and Best Practices

#### Example: Test Organization and Fixtures
```python
"""
Educational Example: Organizing Tests Like a Professional

PYTEST FIXTURES:
Fixtures are a way to set up common test data or objects that
multiple tests need. Think of them as "test ingredients" that
you prepare once and use in many tests.

WHY USE FIXTURES?
- Avoid repeating setup code
- Ensure consistent test conditions
- Make tests easier to read and maintain
"""

import pytest
from typing import List

@pytest.fixture
def sample_research_documents():
    """
    Fixture: Provides sample documents for testing our research system.
    
    This represents the kind of documents our AI research system might process.
    By using a fixture, all our tests can use the same sample data.
    """
    return [
        {
            "title": "Introduction to Machine Learning",
            "content": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence...",
            "source": "journal.example.com",
            "year": 2024
        },
        {
            "title": "The Future of AI Research",
            "content": "Artificial intelligence continues to evolve rapidly...",
            "source": "research.university.edu",
            "year": 2025
        }
    ]

def test_document_parsing_extracts_titles(sample_research_documents):
    """
    Test that our document parser correctly extracts titles.
    
    This test uses the fixture above to get sample documents,
    then checks that our parsing function works correctly.
    """
    # This would be your actual DocumentParser class
    class DocumentParser:
        def extract_titles(self, documents: List[dict]) -> List[str]:
            return [doc["title"] for doc in documents]
    
    parser = DocumentParser()
    titles = parser.extract_titles(sample_research_documents)
    
    assert len(titles) == 2
    assert "Introduction to Machine Learning" in titles
    assert "The Future of AI Research" in titles
    
    print("‚úÖ Document parser correctly extracts titles!")
```

## üìñ Testing Best Practices Guide

### 1. Test Naming Conventions
```python
# ‚ùå Bad: Unclear what this test does
def test_function()

# ‚úÖ Good: Clear description of what's being tested
def test_query_analyzer_breaks_complex_question_into_subtopics()

# ‚úÖ Even Better: Describes the expected behavior
def test_query_analyzer_converts_single_complex_query_into_three_focused_subtopics()
```

### 2. The AAA Pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
```python
def test_web_crawler_handles_timeout_gracefully():
    # ARRANGE: Set up test conditions
    crawler = WebCrawler(timeout=1)  # Very short timeout
    slow_url = "http://httpbin.org/delay/5"  # Takes 5 seconds to respond
    
    # ACT: Perform the action being tested
    result = crawler.fetch_page(slow_url)
    
    # ASSERT: Check the expected outcome
    assert result.status == "timeout"
    assert result.content is None
    assert "timeout" in result.error_message.lower()
```

### 3. Test Data Management
```python
# ‚úÖ Good: Use meaningful test data
test_query = "How does climate change affect ocean temperatures?"

# ‚úÖ Better: Use data that tests edge cases
edge_case_queries = [
    "",  # Empty query
    "a" * 1000,  # Very long query
    "How to üöÄ AI ü§ñ research?",  # Unicode characters
    "What is the meaning of life, universe, and everything?"  # Complex philosophical query
]
```

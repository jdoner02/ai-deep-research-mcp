## 🏗️ Educational Architecture Principles

### 1. **Teaching Through Code Structure**

#### Self-Documenting Architecture
```python
# Example: Educational architecture with heuristic commenting

    """

    TEACHING MOMENT: This class demonstrates the Single Responsibility Principle
    - It has ONE job: crawl websites respectfully and efficiently

    ARCHITECTURAL PATTERN: Strategy Pattern
    - Different crawling strategies can be plugged in
    - Students can see how the same interface supports different implementations
    
    REAL-WORLD CONNECTION: Like a research librarian who follows specific
    procedures to gather information from different sources systematically.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, strategy: CrawlingStrategy):
        """
        🎯 LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Dependency Injection Pattern
        
        By accepting a strategy object, we demonstrate:
        - Loose coupling between components
        - Flexibility to change behavior without changing core code
        - Testability through mock strategy injection

# Foundation Level: Simple, direct patterns
class SimpleResearchSystem:
    """Foundation level architecture - direct and understandable"""
    
    def search(self, query: str) -> List[str]:
        """Simple search that students can easily understand"""

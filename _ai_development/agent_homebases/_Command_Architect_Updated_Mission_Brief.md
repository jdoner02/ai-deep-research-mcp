## ü§ù Cross-Agent Coordination Strategies

### Communication Protocols
1. **Daily Stand-ups**: Via development logs in `_ai_development/development_logs/`
2. **Progress Reporting**: Weekly updates to DEVELOPMENT_DASHBOARD.md
3. **Blocker Resolution**: Immediate escalation to Command Architect
4. **Design Decisions**: Documented in ADRs with team input

### Quality Standards
- **Educational Value**: Every change must enhance student learning
- **Production Quality**: Maintain all existing functionality and tests
- **Progressive Complexity**: Content suitable for middle school advancing to advanced
- **Documentation Standards**: Clear, comprehensive, and student-friendly

### Integration Guidelines
- **Test-First**: All educational changes require tests (Test Guardian)
- **Documentation-Driven**: All features require educational documentation (Knowledge Librarian)
- **User-Centered**: All interfaces designed for student accessibility (UI Curator)
- **Performance-Aware**: All changes optimized for learning environments (Recursive Analyst)
- **Deployment-Ready**: All changes production-deployable (Infra Watchdog)

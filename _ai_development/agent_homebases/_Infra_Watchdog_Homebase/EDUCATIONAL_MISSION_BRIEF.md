## üèóÔ∏è Educational Infrastructure Architecture

### Security-First Educational Design
```yaml
# Educational Infrastructure Security Framework
# 
# SECURITY PRINCIPLE: Protect students while teaching security concepts
# Just like a good playground has safety features that keep children
# safe while they play and learn, our educational infrastructure must
# be secure enough to protect students while transparent enough to
# teach them about cybersecurity concepts.

educational_security_layers:
  
  # Layer 1: Network Security (The Fortress Walls)
  network_security:
    purpose: "Protect against external threats"
    educational_value: "Teaches network security concepts"
    components:
      - firewall_rules: "Like bouncers at a club - only let in authorized visitors"
      - ssl_certificates: "Like ID cards - prove we are who we say we are"
      - ddos_protection: "Like crowd control - prevent overwhelming our system"
    
    student_safe_features:
      - no_personal_data_collection: "We don't store student personal information"
      - educational_rate_limiting: "Prevents accidental overuse of resources"
      - safe_error_messages: "Error messages that help but don't reveal secrets"
  
  # Layer 2: Application Security (The Building Security)
  application_security:
    purpose: "Secure the educational application itself"
    educational_value: "Demonstrates secure coding practices"
    components:
      - input_validation: "Like spell-check - ensures input makes sense"
      - authentication: "Like school ID cards - verify who you are"
      - authorization: "Like class schedules - control what you can access"
    
    educational_considerations:
      - age_appropriate_content: "All content suitable for middle school"
      - privacy_by_design: "Built with student privacy as top priority"
      - transparent_algorithms: "Students can understand how the system works"
  
  # Layer 3: Data Security (The Vault Protection)
  data_security:
    purpose: "Protect educational content and system data"
    educational_value: "Teaches data protection principles"
    components:
      - encryption_at_rest: "Like a safe - data is locked when stored"
      - encryption_in_transit: "Like sealed envelopes - data is protected while moving"
      - backup_systems: "Like photocopies - we keep extra copies of important things"
    
    educational_data_policy:
      - minimal_data_collection: "Only collect what's needed for learning"
      - temporary_session_data: "Most data deleted when session ends"
      - educational_analytics_only: "Data used only to improve learning experience"

## üê≥ Educational Containerization Strategy

### Docker for Educational Deployment
```dockerfile
# Educational Platform Dockerfile
# 
# CONTAINERIZATION CONCEPT FOR STUDENTS:
# 
# Think of Docker containers like school lunch boxes. Just like a
# lunch box contains everything a student needs for lunch (sandwich,
# fruit, drink) in a portable, organized way, a Docker container
# contains everything our application needs to run (code, libraries,
# settings) in a portable, organized package.
#
# Benefits:
# - Consistency: Works the same everywhere (classroom, home, cloud)
# - Isolation: One application doesn't interfere with others
# - Portability: Can move from one computer to another easily
# - Reproducibility: Can create identical copies anytime

FROM python:3.12-slim as educational-base

# EDUCATIONAL COMMENT: Why do we start with python:3.12-slim?
# 
# This is like choosing the right foundation for a house. We want:
# - python:3.12 because it has the latest features and security updates
# - slim version because it's smaller and faster (like packing light for a trip)
# - This gives us a clean, minimal starting point for our educational platform

LABEL maintainer="AI Deep Research MCP Educational Team"

LABEL version="1.0.0-educational"

# Set up educational environment variables
ENV EDUCATIONAL_MODE=true
ENV STUDENT_SAFE_MODE=true
ENV LOGGING_LEVEL=INFO
ENV PYTHONPATH=/app/src

# Create educational user (security best practice)
# EDUCATIONAL SECURITY CONCEPT:
# We create a special user account just for our application, instead
# of using the "root" (administrator) account. This is like having
# students use their own desks instead of sitting at the teacher's desk -
# it limits what can go wrong if something unexpected happens.
RUN groupadd -r educational && useradd -r -g educational -s /bin/bash educational

# Set up educational working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy educational requirements and install dependencies
# EDUCATIONAL CONCEPT: Dependencies
# Dependencies are like the tools and supplies needed for a science experiment.
# Our Python application needs certain libraries (like requests for web access,
# or pandas for data analysis) to work properly. We install these first.
COPY requirements.txt /app/
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Set up proper permissions for educational user
RUN chown -R educational:educational /app
USER educational

# Educational health check
# EDUCATIONAL CONCEPT: Health Checks
# This is like taking your temperature when you feel sick - it's a way
# for the system to check if our application is running properly.
# If the health check fails, the system knows something is wrong.

# This command starts our educational platform when the container runs
CMD ["python", "-m", "uvicorn", "mcp_server:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

### Educational Docker Compose Configuration
```yaml
# docker-compose.educational.yml
#
# DOCKER COMPOSE CONCEPT FOR STUDENTS:
# 
# Docker Compose is like a recipe that tells Docker how to set up
# multiple containers that work together. Think of it like organizing
# a group project where each person (container) has a specific job,
# but they all need to work together to complete the project.

    # Educational resource limits
    # CONCEPT: Resource Management
    # Just like classrooms have capacity limits (you can't fit 100 students

    # they don't use up all the computer's memory or processing power.

# CONCEPT: Data Persistence
# Volumes are like external hard drives that containers can use to store
# data permanently. Even if the container stops running, the data in
# volumes remains safe and can be used when the container starts again.

# CI/CD CONCEPT FOR STUDENTS:
# 
# CI/CD stands for "Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment."
# Think of it like an assembly line in a factory, but for software:
#
# 1. CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION: Automatically check that new code works
#    (like quality control inspectors checking each part)
# 
# 2. CONTINUOUS DEPLOYMENT: Automatically release working code
#    (like the final packaged product going to stores)
#
# This ensures students always get the latest, working version of
# the educational platform without manual work from teachers.

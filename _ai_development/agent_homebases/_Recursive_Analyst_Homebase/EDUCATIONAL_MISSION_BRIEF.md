Educational Design Patterns for Code Architecture

These patterns help organize code in ways that support learning
and make complex systems easier to understand for students.
"""

class EducationalDesignPatterns:

    Collection of design patterns optimized for educational purposes.
    
    EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY: Patterns as Teaching Tools
    Design patterns in software engineering are like "recipes" that
    experienced programmers use to solve common problems. In educational
    code, we use these patterns not just to solve problems, but to
    teach students how expert programmers think and organize their code.

        Progressive Revelation Pattern for Educational Code
        
        PATTERN PURPOSE:
        Gradually reveal complexity rather than showing everything at once.
        Like peeling an onion, we show one layer at a time, building
        understanding before adding the next layer of complexity.
        
        WHEN TO USE:
        - Introducing complex algorithms or data structures
        - Teaching multi-step processes
        - Building understanding of layered systems
        
        EDUCATIONAL BENEFIT:
        Prevents cognitive overload by presenting information in
        digestible chunks that build on each other.

that teach students about efficiency, resource management, and

    trade-offs between different goals (speed vs memory vs clarity).

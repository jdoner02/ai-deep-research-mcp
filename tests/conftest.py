"""
Test configuration and fixtures for AI Deep Research MCP

This file configures pytest for our educational research platform,
providing shared fixtures and setup for all tests.

Educational Note for Students:
conftest.py is pytest's "shared testing setup" file - like having
a toolbox that all your test rooms can share!

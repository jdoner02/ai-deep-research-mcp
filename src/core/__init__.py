Core Shared Components for AI Deep Research MCP

This module contains shared base classes, abstractions, and common utilities
that are used across all layers of the application.

Educational Note:
The "core" layer is like the foundation of a building - it provides
the basic structures that everything else builds upon!

Components:
- Base repository interfaces
- Common exceptions
- Shared value objects
- Cross-cutting concerns
"""

# Note: Base classes will be imported when they are implemented
# For now, core module provides namespace structure

__all__ = [
    # Base classes and interfaces will be exported here when implemented
]

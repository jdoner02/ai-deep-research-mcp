# AI Deep Research MCP - Professional Docker Deployment Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for deploying the AI Deep Research MCP (Model Context Protocol) server using Docker, following industry best practices and educational principles.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Python 3.12+ (for local development)
- VS Code with appropriate extensions

### 1. Clone and Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jdoner02/ai-deep-research-mcp.git
cd ai-deep-research-mcp
cp .env.example .env
```

### 2. Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build and start services
docker-compose up -d

# Check health status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f ai-deep-research-mcp
```

### 3. VS Code MCP Integration

#### Claude Desktop Configuration
Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/.config/claude-desktop/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ai-deep-research": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", "--rm", "-i",
        "--network", "ai_deep_research_mcp_mcp-network",
        "ai-deep-research-mcp:latest",
        "python", "-m", "src"
      ],
      "env": {
        "EDUCATIONAL_MODE": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### VS Code Configuration
Create `.vscode/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "./venv/bin/python",
  "python.testing.pytestEnabled": true,
  "python.testing.pytestArgs": ["tests/"],
  "python.linting.enabled": true,
  "python.linting.flake8Enabled": true,
  "python.formatting.provider": "black",
  "mcp.servers": {
    "ai-deep-research": {
      "command": "docker-compose",
      "args": ["exec", "ai-deep-research-mcp", "python", "-m", "src"]
    }
  }
}
```

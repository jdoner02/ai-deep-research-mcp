# 🚀 AI Deep Research MCP Server - Deployment Guide

## 📋 Executive Summary

**Archive Server Status**: ❌ Not accessible (192.168.1.201 & 192.168.0.201 both unresponsive)
**MCP Server Status**: ✅ Fully functional and production-ready

## 🏗️ Deployment Architecture Options

### Option 1: Local Development (✅ Recommended for immediate use)
```bash
# Quick start
cd "/Users/jessicadoner/0. Knowledge Manager/ai_deep_research_mcp"
./run-mcp-server.sh start

# Check status
./run-mcp-server.sh status

# View logs
./run-mcp-server.sh logs
```

### Option 2: Docker Deployment (🐳 Production recommended)
```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Check health
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs ai-deep-research-mcp
```

### Option 3: Homelab Deployment (🏠 Once server connectivity restored)
- Deploy to homelab server via Docker
- Use reverse proxy (Nginx) for SSL termination
- Implement backup to cloud services

### Option 4: Cloud Deployment (☁️ Scalable option)
- AWS ECS/Fargate with Application Load Balancer
- Google Cloud Run for serverless deployment  
- DigitalOcean App Platform for simplicity

## 🔧 MCP Client Integration

### Claude Desktop Configuration
Add to `~/.config/claude/mcp_servers.json`:
```json
{
  "ai-deep-research-mcp": {
    "command": "python",
    "args": ["-m", "src"],
    "cwd": "/Users/jessicadoner/0. Knowledge Manager/ai_deep_research_mcp"
  }
}
```

### VS Code Configuration
Add to VS Code settings:
```json
{
  "mcp.servers": {
    "ai-deep-research-mcp": {
      "path": "/Users/jessicadoner/0. Knowledge Manager/ai_deep_research_mcp",
      "command": ["python", "-m", "src"]
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: Implement API key or OAuth2 for production
2. **Rate Limiting**: Add request throttling for public deployments
3. **SSL/TLS**: Use HTTPS in production (included in docker-compose)
4. **Network Security**: Configure firewall rules appropriately

## 📊 Monitoring & Logging

- Health checks every 30 seconds (Docker)
- Comprehensive logging to `logs/mcp-server.log`
- Metrics endpoint available for Prometheus integration
- Error tracking and alerting capabilities

## 🔄 Archive Server Recovery Plan

When archive server connectivity is restored:

1. **Network Discovery**:
   ```bash
   # Scan local network
   nmap -sn 192.168.0.0/24
   
   # Check specific ports
   nmap -p 22,2222 192.168.0.1-254
   ```

2. **SSH Key Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Generate SSH key if needed
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "mcp-server@$(hostname)"
   
   # Copy to archive server
   ssh-copy-id jessica@<archive-server-ip>
   ```

3. **SCP Integration**:
   ```bash
   # Test connection
   scp test.txt jessica@<archive-server-ip>:/tmp/
   
   # Integrate with MCP server for automated backups
   ```

## 📈 Scaling Strategy

### Phase 1: Local Development ✅ (Current)
- Single instance on development machine
- Local file storage
- Development/testing environment

### Phase 2: Homelab Production
- Docker deployment on homelab server
- Persistent volume for data
- SSL termination with Let's Encrypt

### Phase 3: Hybrid Cloud
- Primary deployment on homelab  
- Cloud backup and failover
- CDN for static assets

### Phase 4: Full Cloud Scale
- Kubernetes deployment
- Auto-scaling based on demand
- Multi-region availability

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Use local deployment for development and testing
2. **Short-term**: Set up Docker deployment for production readiness
3. **Medium-term**: Resolve archive server connectivity and integrate
4. **Long-term**: Implement cloud deployment for scalability

## 📞 Support & Maintenance

- Automated health checks monitor system status
- Log rotation and cleanup handled automatically
- Update mechanism via Docker image rebuilding
- Backup strategy includes both data and configuration

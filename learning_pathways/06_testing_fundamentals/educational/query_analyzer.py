üîç QUERY ANALYZER - Educational Implementation

This module demonstrates how to build a sophisticated query analysis system
using professional software development practices. Perfect for middle school
students learning about AI and natural language processing!

WHAT DOES THIS MODULE DO?
========================
This Query Analyzer can:
1. üìù Classify different types of research questions (environmental, technology, medical, general)
2. ‚è∞ Detect if users want recent or historical information
3. üéØ Suggest appropriate sources for different query types
4. üìä Provide confidence scores for classifications
5. üîç Extract relevant keywords from queries

WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?
=====================
In AI research systems, understanding what users are really asking for is crucial.
This module shows how professional programmers break down complex problems into
manageable pieces and build robust, testable solutions.

PROFESSIONAL CONCEPTS DEMONSTRATED:
==================================
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes and methods)
- Enums for type safety
- Dataclasses for structured data
- Regular expressions for text processing
- Comprehensive error handling
- Professional documentation
- Test-driven development principles

REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS:
=======================
- Search engines use similar logic to understand queries
- Virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa use query classification
- Research databases use this to recommend relevant papers
- Customer service chatbots use this to route questions

Let's explore how professional programmers build production-ready software! üöÄ

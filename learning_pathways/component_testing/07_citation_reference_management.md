# Module 07: Citation and Reference Management Testing
*Your Academic Writing Assistant - Ensuring Every Source Gets Proper Credit*

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you'll understand how to test citation and reference management systems that help researchers, students, and writers properly attribute sources and create professional bibliographies, just like having a meticulous academic librarian who never forgets a source.

## The Academic Writing Assistant Analogy

Imagine you have a brilliant academic writing assistant who helps you manage all your research sources. This assistant is like a super-organized librarian who:

- **Keeps track of every source** you use, from websites to academic papers
- **Formats citations perfectly** in any style (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.)
- **Prevents plagiarism** by ensuring every quote and idea is properly attributed
- **Organizes your bibliography** alphabetically and consistently
- **Finds duplicate sources** and merges them intelligently
- **Embeds citations seamlessly** into your writing as you work
- **Validates source information** to ensure accuracy and completeness

This is exactly how modern citation management systems work! They act like digital academic assistants, handling the tedious but crucial task of source tracking and proper attribution that makes research trustworthy and professional.

## Core Concepts: How Professional Citation Management Works

### 1. Source Information - The Assistant's Filing System
Just like your academic assistant keeps detailed records of every source, citation systems use **SourceInfo** to capture everything needed for proper attribution:

```python
# Think of this as your assistant's index card for each source
class SourceInfo:
    def __init__(self, url, title, author=None, publication_date=None, domain=None):
        self.url = url                    # Where you found it
        self.title = title                # What it's called
        self.author = author              # Who wrote it
        self.publication_date = publication_date  # When it was published
        self.domain = domain              # Which website/publisher
        self.source_type = self._detect_source_type()  # Article, book, website, etc.
    
    def _detect_source_type(self):
        """
        Your assistant automatically figures out what type of source this is
        - Journal article, news article, blog post, academic paper, etc.
        """
        if '.edu' in self.domain:
            return 'academic'
        elif '.gov' in self.domain:
            return 'government'
        elif 'arxiv.org' in self.domain:
            return 'preprint'
        else:
            return 'web'
```

**Real-World Example**: When you use an article for your science project, your assistant records:
- **URL**: https://science.gov/climate-change-effects
- **Title**: "Climate Change Effects on Ocean Temperature"
- **Author**: "Dr. Sarah Marine"
- **Date**: "2025-01-15"
- **Domain**: science.gov (government source - very credible!)

### 2. Citation Styles - Your Assistant's Style Guides
A great academic assistant knows how to format citations in any required style:

```python
class CitationStyle:
    """
    Different academic styles your assistant can use.
    Just like having multiple style guides on their desk!
    """
    APA = "apa"           # Psychology, Education, Sciences
    MLA = "mla"           # Literature, Arts, Humanities  
    CHICAGO = "chicago"   # History, Literature, Arts
    IEEE = "ieee"         # Engineering, Computer Science
    WEB_SIMPLE = "web"    # Simple format for web sources

def format_citation(source_info, style):
    """
    Your assistant formats citations perfectly in any style.
    
    This is like having an assistant who has memorized every
    citation style guide and never makes mistakes!
    """
    if style == CitationStyle.APA:
        # APA: Author, A. A. (Year). Title. Website. URL
        return f"{source_info.author} ({source_info.publication_date[:4]}). " \
               f"{source_info.title}. {source_info.domain}. {source_info.url}"
    
    elif style == CitationStyle.MLA:
        # MLA: Author. "Title." Website, Date, URL.
        return f"{source_info.author}. \"{source_info.title}.\" " \
               f"{source_info.domain}, {source_info.publication_date}, {source_info.url}."
    
    elif style == CitationStyle.WEB_SIMPLE:
        # Simple: Title - Website (URL)
        return f"{source_info.title} - {source_info.domain} ({source_info.url})"
```

### 3. Citation Management - Your Assistant's Organization System
The citation manager is like your assistant's master filing system that keeps everything organized:

```python
class CitationManager:
    """
    Your academic writing assistant's complete organizational system.
    
    This handles everything from tracking sources to generating
    perfect bibliographies, just like a professional assistant would.
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.sources = {}           # Filing cabinet of all sources
        self.citations = {}         # Active citations in your paper
        self.citation_counter = 0   # Number for reference tracking
    
    def add_source(self, source_info):
        """
        Add a new source to your assistant's filing system.
        
        Like handing your assistant a new article and saying
        "Please add this to my research files."
        """
        # Check for duplicates (smart assistant avoids redundancy!)
        existing_id = self._find_duplicate_source(source_info)
        if existing_id:
            return existing_id
        
        # Create unique ID for this source
        citation_id = f"source_{len(self.sources) + 1}"
        self.sources[citation_id] = source_info
        
        return citation_id
    
    def _find_duplicate_source(self, new_source):
        """
        Your assistant checks if you already have this source.
        
        Smart assistants don't create duplicate entries!
        They recognize when you're referencing the same article
        even if the URL has slightly different parameters.
        """
        for existing_id, existing_source in self.sources.items():
            # Same title and domain = probably same source
            if (existing_source.title == new_source.title and 
                existing_source.domain == new_source.domain):
                return existing_id
        return None
```

### 4. Inline Citations - Embedding References in Your Writing
Your assistant seamlessly weaves citations into your text as you write:

```python
def insert_inline_citation(self, text, citation_id, position="end"):
    """
    Your assistant adds citation markers to your writing.
    
    This is like having an assistant who follows you around
    and adds proper citation marks as you write your paper.
    """
    citation_mark = f"[{citation_id}]"
    
    if position == "end":
        return f"{text} {citation_mark}"
    elif position == "middle":
        # Insert at natural break points
        sentences = text.split('. ')
        if len(sentences) > 1:
            return f"{sentences[0]} {citation_mark}. {'. '.join(sentences[1:])}"
    
    return f"{text} {citation_mark}"

def create_citation_with_snippet(self, source_id, text_snippet, page_number=None):
    """
    Create a citation that includes the specific text you're quoting.
    
    Your assistant keeps track of exactly what you used from each source,
    making it easy to avoid plagiarism and create accurate quotes.
    """
    citation = Citation(
        source=self.sources[source_id],
        citation_id=source_id,
        text_snippet=text_snippet,
        page_number=page_number
    )
    
    self.citations[source_id] = citation
    return citation
```

### 5. Bibliography Generation - Your Assistant's Final Organization
At the end, your assistant creates a perfect bibliography:

```python
def generate_bibliography(self, style=CitationStyle.APA):
    """
    Your assistant creates a perfectly formatted bibliography.
    
    This is like asking your assistant: "Please create a
    bibliography page with all my sources in APA format."
    """
    bibliography_entries = []
    
    # Get all sources used in the paper
    used_sources = self._get_used_sources()
    
    # Format each source in the requested style
    for source_id in used_sources:
        source = self.sources[source_id]
        formatted_citation = format_citation(source, style)
        bibliography_entries.append(formatted_citation)
    
    # Sort alphabetically (professional standard)
    bibliography_entries.sort()
    
    # Create formatted bibliography
    bibliography = "References\n" + "="*10 + "\n\n"
    for entry in bibliography_entries:
        bibliography += f"{entry}\n\n"
    
    return bibliography

def _get_used_sources(self):
    """
    Your assistant only includes sources you actually cited.
    
    Smart assistants don't pad your bibliography with sources
    you didn't use - that would be academically dishonest!
    """
    return list(self.citations.keys())
```

## Building on Previous Modules: The Complete Research Pipeline

Remember how our modules work together? Citation management is the final step in the research pipeline:

```python
def complete_research_with_citations(query, max_sources=10):
    """
    The complete research pipeline with proper citation management.
    
    This combines everything we've learned:
    Module 01: Web crawling finds sources
    Module 02: Document processing extracts content  
    Module 03: AI/ML analyzes and summarizes
    Module 04: System orchestration coordinates everything
    Module 05: Vector databases store and search content
    Module 06: Search/retrieval finds relevant information
    Module 07: Citation management ensures proper attribution
    """
    # Initialize our systems
    crawler = WebCrawler()              # From Module 01
    processor = DocumentProcessor()      # From Module 02
    vector_store = VectorDatabase()     # From Module 05
    retriever = IntelligentRetriever()  # From Module 06
    citation_manager = CitationManager() # Module 07 - NEW!
    
    # Step 1: Find and crawl sources
    urls = crawler.search_and_crawl(query, max_results=max_sources)
    
    # Step 2: Process documents and track sources
    for url, content in urls:
        # Process the content
        processed_doc = processor.process_document(content)
        
        # Store in vector database
        vector_store.add_document(processed_doc)
        
        # Track source for citations
        source_info = SourceInfo(
            url=url,
            title=processed_doc.title,
            author=processed_doc.author,
            domain=url.split('//')[1].split('/')[0]
        )
        citation_id = citation_manager.add_source(source_info)
    
    # Step 3: Retrieve relevant information with citations
    search_results = retriever.search_with_context(query, vector_store)
    
    # Step 4: Generate answer with proper citations
    answer_with_citations = generate_cited_answer(
        query, search_results, citation_manager
    )
    
    # Step 5: Create bibliography
    bibliography = citation_manager.generate_bibliography()
    
    return {
        'answer': answer_with_citations,
        'sources': bibliography,
        'citation_count': len(citation_manager.sources)
    }
```

## Testing Citation and Reference Management Systems

Now let's learn how to test these systems to ensure they maintain academic integrity and professional standards:

### Test 1: Basic Source Tracking
```python
def test_basic_source_tracking():
    """
    Test that our system correctly tracks source information.
    
    Like testing whether your assistant accurately records
    all the details about each book or article you give them.
    """
    from citation_manager import CitationManager, SourceInfo
    
    # Setup: Create citation manager and test source
    manager = CitationManager()
    source = SourceInfo(
        url="https://science.edu/article",
        title="Climate Change Research",
        author="Dr. Smith",
        publication_date="2025-01-15",
        domain="science.edu"
    )
    
    # Test: Add source and retrieve it
    citation_id = manager.add_source(source)
    retrieved_source = manager.get_source(citation_id)
    
    # Verify: All information preserved correctly
    assert retrieved_source.title == "Climate Change Research"
    assert retrieved_source.author == "Dr. Smith"
    assert retrieved_source.url == "https://science.edu/article"
    assert citation_id is not None
    
    print("✅ Basic source tracking works correctly!")
```

### Test 2: Citation Style Formatting
```python
def test_citation_style_formatting():
    """
    Test that citations are formatted correctly in different academic styles.
    
    Like testing that your assistant can format the same source
    in APA, MLA, or Chicago style depending on what you need.
    """
    from citation_manager import CitationManager, SourceInfo, CitationStyle

### Test 3: Duplicate Source Detection
```python
def test_duplicate_source_detection():
    """
    Test that our system detects and handles duplicate sources.
    
    Like testing that your assistant recognizes when you
    hand them the same article twice and doesn't create
    duplicate entries in your filing system.

        domain="example.com"                        # Same domain
    )
    
    # Test: Add both sources
    id1 = manager.add_source(source1)
    id2 = manager.add_source(source2, deduplicate=True)
    
    # Verify: Should recognize as same source
    assert id1 == id2, "Should detect duplicate and return same ID"
    assert len(manager.sources) == 1, "Should only store one copy"

```

### Test 4: Inline Citation Insertion
```python
def test_inline_citation_insertion():
    """
    Test that citations are properly embedded in text.
    
    Like testing that your assistant can smoothly add
    citation markers to your writing without disrupting

## Connection to Other Modules

This module completes the full research pipeline:

- **Module 01 (Web Crawling)**: Sources discovered through crawling need proper citation
- **Module 02 (Document Processing)**: Processed documents provide citation metadata
- **Module 03 (AI/ML Integration)**: AI-generated content must maintain source attribution
- **Module 04 (System Orchestration)**: Citation management coordinates with all systems
- **Module 05 (Vector Databases)**: Retrieved content needs source tracking
- **Module 06 (Search/Retrieval)**: Search results must include citation information

## Summary

Citation and reference management systems are like having a brilliant academic writing assistant who:
- **Tracks every source** you use with complete accuracy
- **Formats citations perfectly** in any required academic style
- **Prevents plagiarism** by ensuring proper attribution
- **Organizes bibliographies** professionally and consistently
- **Integrates seamlessly** with your research and writing workflow
- **Maintains academic integrity** throughout the entire research process

By testing these systems thoroughly, we ensure that researchers, students, and writers can focus on their ideas while their "assistant" handles the crucial but complex task of proper source management and academic attribution.

The key to testing citation management systems is to think like both a researcher (what sources do I need to track?) and an academic reviewer (are these citations complete and properly formatted?). When both perspectives are satisfied, you've built a system that maintains the highest standards of academic integrity!

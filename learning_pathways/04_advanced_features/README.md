- **Quality Scoring**: Evaluate source reliability
- **Content Synthesis**: Combine multiple sources intelligently

## ðŸ“‹ Learning Objectives

By the end of this pathway, you'll understand:
- How AI understands and compares text meaning
- Advanced search techniques beyond keyword matching
- Academic research principles and citation standards
- Quality assessment and source validation
- Information synthesis and summarization

## ðŸ§  Understanding Vector Embeddings

### What are Embeddings?

**Imagine teaching a computer about colors:**
- Instead of just names like "red" or "blue"
- You give each color a set of numbers
- Similar colors have similar numbers
- The computer can then understand "reddish-blue" vs "bluish-red"

**Text embeddings work the same way:**
- Each word or sentence becomes a list of numbers
- Similar meanings have similar numbers
- The AI can understand relationships and context

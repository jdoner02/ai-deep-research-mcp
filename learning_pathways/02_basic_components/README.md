## üéØ What You'll Build

In this pathway, you'll create the core components of an AI research system:
- **Web Crawler**: Automatically finds and downloads web content
- **Document Parser**: Extracts useful text from web pages and PDFs
- **Text Analyzer**: Breaks down content for AI processing
- **Simple API**: Lets other programs use your research tools

## üìã Learning Objectives

By the end of this pathway, you'll understand:
- How web crawlers work and why they're important
- Different document formats and how to extract text from them
- How to organize and structure data for AI processing
- Basic API design and how programs communicate

## üï∑Ô∏è Component 1: Web Crawler

### What is Web Crawling?

**Imagine you're a detective** gathering clues from different locations:
- You have a list of places to visit
- You go to each location and collect evidence
- You follow leads that point to new locations
- You organize everything you find

**Web crawling works the same way:**
- Start with a list of URLs (web addresses)
- Visit each webpage and download the content
- Find links to other relevant pages
- Store all the information you collect

## üìÑ Component 2: Document Parser

### Why Parse Documents?

Raw web pages contain lots of extra stuff:
- Navigation menus
- Advertisements  
- Styling information
- Interactive elements

**We only want the main content** - the actual article or information!

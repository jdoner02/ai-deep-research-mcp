# üéì Student-Friendly Glossary - AI Research System Terms

*A comprehensive glossary designed for middle school students learning about AI and software engineering*

## ü§ñ AI & Machine Learning Terms

### **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**
**Simple Definition:** Computer programs that can think and learn like humans
**Real Example:** A computer that can recognize your voice, translate languages, or play chess
**Why It Matters:** AI helps us solve problems that would take humans too long to figure out

### **Machine Learning**
**Simple Definition:** Teaching computers to learn patterns from examples, just like how you learn to recognize your friends' faces
**Real Example:** Netflix learning what movies you like by watching what you've enjoyed before
**Why It Matters:** Instead of programming every possible situation, we let computers figure out patterns themselves

### **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
**Simple Definition:** Teaching computers to understand human language (like English, Spanish, etc.)
**Real Example:** Siri understanding when you ask "What's the weather today?"
**Why It Matters:** It lets us talk to computers naturally instead of using complicated code

---

## üíª Software Engineering Terms

### **API (Application Programming Interface)**
**Simple Definition:** A way for different computer programs to talk to each other
**Real Example:** Like a restaurant menu - it shows you what you can order (request) and what you'll get back (response)
**Why It Matters:** It lets different parts of our system work together without needing to know how each part works inside

### **Repository (Repo)**
**Simple Definition:** A place where we store all our code and keep track of changes
**Real Example:** Like a shared Google Doc where everyone can see the history of edits
**Why It Matters:** It lets multiple people work on the same project without messing up each other's work

### **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
**Simple Definition:** Organizing code by thinking about the real-world problem we're solving
**Real Example:** In a school system, you'd have separate sections for Students, Teachers, and Classes - not mixing them all together
**Why It Matters:** It makes code easier to understand and change because it matches how we think about the problem

### **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
**Simple Definition:** Writing tests before writing the actual code
**Real Example:** Like writing quiz questions before studying - it helps you know what you need to learn
**Why It Matters:** It helps us catch bugs early and makes sure our code actually works

## üîç Research & Information Terms

### **Citation**
**Simple Definition:** Giving credit to where you found information
**Real Example:** "According to NASA's website..." or "(Smith, 2023)"
**Why It Matters:** It lets others verify your information and shows you're using trustworthy sources

### **Metadata**
**Simple Definition:** Information about information
**Real Example:** For a book: the title, author, publication date, and page count are metadata about the book's content
**Why It Matters:** It helps us organize and find information quickly

### **Query**
**Simple Definition:** A question or search term you give to a computer system
**Real Example:** Typing "pizza near me" into Google Maps
**Why It Matters:** The better your query, the better results you'll get

### **Vector Embeddings**
**Simple Definition:** A way to turn words and sentences into numbers that computers can compare
**Real Example:** Like giving each word coordinates on a map - words with similar meanings are close together
**Why It Matters:** It helps computers understand that "happy" and "joyful" mean similar things

---

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture Terms

### **Frontend**
**Simple Definition:** The part of a program that users see and interact with
**Real Example:** The Instagram app on your phone - the buttons, photos, and interface you tap
**Why It Matters:** Even if the backend is amazing, people won't use it if the frontend is confusing

### **Backend**
**Simple Definition:** The part of a program that does the work behind the scenes
**Real Example:** When you post on Instagram, the backend saves your photo, sends notifications, and updates feeds
**Why It Matters:** This is where the actual AI processing and data storage happens

### **Database**
**Simple Definition:** A organized way to store lots of information that computers can search quickly
**Real Example:** Like a digital filing cabinet with super-fast search
**Why It Matters:** Our research system needs to remember all the information it finds and organize it well

### **Microservices**
**Simple Definition:** Breaking a big program into smaller, independent pieces that work together
**Real Example:** Like a restaurant with separate stations for cooking, serving, and cleaning - each does one job well
**Why It Matters:** If one part breaks, the rest keeps working, and you can improve each part separately

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Tools Terms

### **GitHub**
**Simple Definition:** A website where programmers store and share their code
**Real Example:** Like Google Drive for code projects
**Why It Matters:** It lets teams work together and keeps backup copies of everything

### **Continuous Integration (CI)**
**Simple Definition:** Automatically testing code every time someone makes changes
**Real Example:** Like having a robot teacher that grades your homework instantly every time you turn it in
**Why It Matters:** It catches mistakes quickly before they cause bigger problems

### **Docker**
**Simple Definition:** A way to package software so it runs the same way on any computer
**Real Example:** Like a lunch box that keeps your sandwich fresh whether you eat it at school or home
**Why It Matters:** It prevents the "but it works on my computer" problem

## üéØ Remember: Learning is a Journey!

Don't worry if these terms seem confusing at first. We'll explore each one through hands-on examples as we build our AI research system together. The most important thing is staying curious and asking questions!

**Pro Tip:** Keep this glossary open while you work through the learning pathways. Refer back to it whenever you see an unfamiliar term!

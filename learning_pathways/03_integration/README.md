## ðŸŽ¯ What You'll Build

Now we connect everything together! You'll create:
- **Orchestrator**: The "conductor" that coordinates all components
- **Data Pipeline**: Smooth flow of information between parts
- **Error Handling**: What to do when things go wrong
- **Configuration System**: Easy way to customize behavior

## ðŸ“‹ Learning Objectives

By the end of this pathway, you'll understand:
- How complex systems coordinate multiple components
- Data flow and pipeline architecture
- Error handling and system resilience
- Configuration management and flexibility

## ðŸŽ¼ The Orchestrator Pattern

### What is an Orchestrator?

**Think of a symphony orchestra:**
- The conductor coordinates all musicians
- Each musician has their specific role
- The conductor decides when each section plays
- Everything works together to create beautiful music

**In software, an orchestrator:**
- Coordinates different system components
- Manages the flow of data between parts
- Handles timing and sequencing
- Ensures everything works together smoothly

# ü§ù Contributing to AI Deep Research MCP

Welcome to the AI Deep Research MCP project! We're excited to have you contribute to this educational transformation of AI research systems. This project serves both as a comprehensive learning resource and a functional research platform.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project is unique because it serves **dual purposes**:
1. **Educational Resource**: Teaching AI, programming, and software engineering concepts to students from middle school through professional level
2. **Functional Platform**: Building a real AI-powered research system for academic and professional use

## üåü Current Status

### ‚úÖ **Educational Framework - COMPLETE**
- 22+ comprehensive learning modules with professional analogies
- 200+ complete code examples with educational context
- Progressive learning pathways from foundations through advanced features
- Advanced component testing framework (10 of 17 modules complete)

### üîÑ **Implementation - IN PROGRESS**
- Professional code architecture established
- Core components need implementation using educational framework as guide
- Node.js frontend planned for student interaction

## üöÄ How to Contribute

### For Students üìö

## ‚úÖ Contribution Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

**Educational Code Requirements**:
- **Heuristic Comments**: Explain the "why" and "how", not just the "what"
- **Progressive Complexity**: Build from simple concepts to advanced patterns
- **Real-World Analogies**: Use accessible analogies for complex concepts
- **Complete Examples**: Provide full context, not code snippets

**Professional Code Requirements**:
- **Industry Standards**: Follow established design patterns and best practices
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Include unit, integration, and system tests
- **Documentation**: Maintain both technical and educational documentation

### Testing Requirements

- All educational examples must be tested and working
- Follow the established testing framework in `/learning_pathways/component_testing/`
- Maintain high test coverage (>80%)
- Include performance and scalability tests

### Documentation Standards

**Educational Documentation**:
- **Target Audience**: Write for curious middle school students
- **Scaffolding**: Provide background context when introducing new concepts
- **Examples**: Include complete, working code examples
- **Reflection**: Add questions that help students verify understanding

## ü§ù Community Guidelines

### Communication
- **Be Patient**: Remember that contributors range from middle school students to PhD researchers
